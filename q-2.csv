If every one of us can practice these we are better than Singapore by 2025,,  GDP is the number given to the value of manufacture. 

Ahem...

 In this age of media reality the good minister might be banking on an entirely new source of value.

 The value of manufacturing the GDP number.  Unless, CBSL is wrong our liquid reserves are USD 5.1 billion. Another  1.1 billion needs to be paid within 30 days.  Within 12 months it is USD 4.5 billion. This all in US dollars. You cannot inflate that or print that.  That is not going to go away. That is the reality. Yes, you can do it.. You can see a sunshine even inside a deep mine..  @GotabayaR @PresRajapaksa @SecPompeo 
Please work on to allow @PayPal business accounts (Merchant) in Sri Lanka. There are lot of people in here willing to enter the international market, however it is impossible due to above issue. Among them most are the younger generation. Ecommerce sector is growing in SL gradually and ready to run with the global markets. Lot of traditional product manufacturers are now arising with the current government policies."
