Are you indicating that those 9 years is good? What’s the reason for the depreciation at all? And what about depreciation from Oct26th 2018? Since there are more educated people on twitter than on facebook, can you put percentage wise figures as well than mere numbers when it comes to depreciation. As Leon has mentioned pls break 2018 into before 2018 Oct 26th and what happened within that 50 days pls. Thanks It will depreciate even further due to the loss caused by the architects of the #couplk October 26 https://youtu.be/ukYSZtGfkHg

 In this age of media reality the good minister might be banking on an entirely new source of value.

 The value of manufacturing the GDP number.  Unless, CBSL is wrong our liquid reserves are USD 5.1 billion. Another  1.1 billion needs to be paid within 30 days.  Within 12 months it is USD 4.5 billion. This all in US dollars. You cannot inflate that or print that.  That is not going to go away. That is the reality. Yes, you can do it.. You can see a sunshine even inside a deep mine..  @GotabayaR @PresRajapaksa @SecPompeo 
Please work on to allow @PayPal business accounts (Merchant) in Sri Lanka. There are lot of people in here willing to enter the international market, however it is impossible due to above issue. Among them most are the younger generation. Ecommerce sector is growing in SL gradually and ready to run with the global markets. Lot of traditional product manufacturers are now arising with the current government policies."

Take action protect the confidence of investors.
Make sure this kind of silly mistakes will not happen in future I would like to Thank you taking an action . But it’s quite delay.. Hope this is not just words. 22% drop and nothing happened even with sec and cse cleared this credit saga. If you intervene quickly you can at least prevent big  disaster being happening at the moment. Any way a big damage already done. My idea it's too late you came to intervene but at least for the future it will help.I personally convinced more than 150 foreign workers to invest in Sri Lanka to get those hold foreign currency into our country. But 85% of my these investors got bad impression about our SEC,CSE and Brokers for purposely bringing the market down for personal agenda that is they collected their clients stocks @ low prices to their accounts."

Confidence was damaged by Regulators & brokers. Now government has to stimulate the market and uplift the confidence. 

We need heroes and leaders , when the chips are down. Dollar is a matter, witnessing the collapse @CSE_Media Best way to do is start to buy using government funds (EPF,ETF..) at least this stage & give confidence to the investors ASAP.

Since all the shares are at bottom. We need actions not the tweets. Spot on. Mewa hondai konde badapu cheenunta. Investors have fully understand it while margine providers needs to withdraw our longterm investment in front of short term stock market crash. Agreed with the statement but how believe that ASP drop 9000 to 6,854 within 7week. this is not good for healthy market. you should do something to stable this situation, not enough giving Twitter Msg. Motivate funds to buy ASAP and foreign buying as well. Thank you. Most of CSE investors have ran out of buying power. So now government Funds needs to stimulate the market by buying good shares and pushing ASP at least by 500 points. When the market goes up, investors will get additional buying power. That's how you can revive CSE again. Hope our brilliant CMM appreciates your excellent point."

We could not find some essentials like milk powder and sugar in the market.
And as an economist, you failed and we are starving.
Even with people with high bank balances cannot survive without food  And people including daily wage earners should be alive to look after their families.

Privileged Sri Lankans making fun of people in queues at liquor stores yesterday. Most of those men are buying alcohol to resell, so that they can use the profits to feed their families. Lockdowns will hit the most vulnerable while the arm chair critics whine from cushy homes. Hospitals are full and running out of resources. What are your suggestions to slow down the spread and give the health syastem to stabilize? Will they live to pay loans if things go like this ? I was of the same opinion till 2 weeks back. Yet when people start dying helplessly at home without proper medical care/monitoring we cannot just turn a blind eye as a civilized society. Those politicos who instigated shouting protest rallies should be held accountable. You didnt think of that in March 2020 when we had a handful of cases you closed down for nearly 3 months now deaths are increasing and the health sector about to collapse you think of it? You should've invested in the health sector instead of building a tower which is of no use I do agree with you. Now we are at a point where closing the country would result financial ruin for the daily wage workers, low income individuals (and their families) as well as businesses.

Sir when you mentioned the USD 500 million figure in your Speech yesterday , did you mean that to be the 1% Penalty which would add to the Government Revenue or the total USD inflow ? If it's the 1% then the Country will receive a total inflow of USD 50 Billion ! Which is it ?  We are with you Yet you are suspected of aiding, abetting, and in certain scenarios masterminding, the mass corruption and pillaging of public coffers in this country.

#SriLanka #Bloomberghttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2021-09-17/sri-lanka-central-bank-chief-pledges-to-ease-asset-purchases-video … Hope you're are going to steer the CBSL out of the issues facing it and helping the Citizen's of this country best to you and a Bright    Future for Sri Lanka Good Interview. look forward to the new #roadmap Great That’s good. Maybe you explained to them that printing money will not lead to inflation.  But the oil hedging loss was fantastic previously when you were the governer #SriLankan people,  an idiot is controlling of your money. Don’t keep your savings in cash. Widen tax base, public sector wage/ hiring freeze, sell SoEs, big ticket FDI in key high value & cash crop industries, devalue FX, mandatory export recipt repatriation, lift tourism restrictions. 
Its not very complicated. Only complicated to implement.  Eagerly waiting to see what is going to happen."

Given the economic situation our country is in, I doubt we should tap into any experience of any of these guys... and many currently in office.... Central banks are supposed to be independent to ensure monetary policy doesn’t get corrupted by election minded politicians and their fiscal policies. Appointment of @an_cabraal violates that principle. Therefore I don’t see much for #lka’s future in this appointment.

He's making the best possible effort to put things right by radiating positive vibes.
You Reap what you Sow. Rather than pinpointing Moody, you better work effectively to mitigate current financial calamity. Now you have all powers, prove your self through results. Get the support from @HarshadeSilvaMP if he is willing to help to develop #srilanka  So pissed off at Moody’s . They think we can’t print more money to fix our situation . Tell them @an_cabraal printing money is the solution Lol this is becoming a joke now  Question ! Will They revise their stance seeing above  

We thought you are there to make corrective action, rather than twitting  Moody’s, by its own admission after the 2008 fin crash, stated that they only give “opinions” when asked why all the financial institutions, like the Lehman Brothers, had highest Moody’s ranking up until the morning of the crash. So, save to say, Moody’s proved their “integrity”. Hahahahah"

If many CITIZENS wants leave, capitalize e opportunity & send them to all prospective countries removing all HIGH CHARGES by agencies. 

Condition all to send $ remittances immediately Send all lazy government sector employees first! Not according to banks Some government university students leave the country right after graduating and not coming back. Bond should be there to make sure you serve your country at least for 10 years to payback the SL tax money or send certain amount of USD remittance back within a given period.. Agree ලබ්බට තියපු අත පුහුලටත් තියනවා  @an_cabraal What about remittance by Sri Lankan who is doing remote works? Is @CBSL  considering it as ""Service export""? Yes, that was the discussion. NO BANK WAS ASKING TO CONVERT NON RESIDENT WORKER REMITTANCES.  Legalise crypto currency withdrowel to Local bank accounts.. not deposits.. lots of people make/earn  income by trading n holding crypto cruncies  .. let them bring some usd to local banks. Increase the rate by LKR 50 minimum to see the inflow. When the whole world is changing embrace the change, people will not listen to you, you have to Listen to people. Migrant temittance are the key to our economy n they deserve better."

Nothing else. @RealBRajapaksa @CBSL #lka ඒවා මෙයාට අදල නෑ. දැනුත් ලොකු කතානේ. @IMFNews This guy thinks he is an expert on the subject and getting advice from IMF is a shame  because he thinks IMF is not up to his level. that's why he is twitting like this.. Cabbo, Finance minister stating that they have trusted “Undial” methods for Government payments. I think you are in the same Governor position at that time. Not only that, the GOSL has violated the sanction against the North Korea. Amazing, after all we can’t let the factory in Biyagama go to waste. Let’s make good use of them money printers while we can. Thank you governor for clearing the air!
