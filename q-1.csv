If every one of us can practice these we are better than Singapore by 2025,,  GDP is the number given to the value of manufacture. 

Ahem...

 In this age of media reality the good minister might be banking on an entirely new source of value.

 The value of manufacturing the GDP number.  Unless, CBSL is wrong our liquid reserves are USD 5.1 billion. Another  1.1 billion needs to be paid within 30 days.  Within 12 months it is USD 4.5 billion. This all in US dollars. You cannot inflate that or print that.  That is not going to go away. That is the reality. Yes, you can do it.. You can see a sunshine even inside a deep mine..  @GotabayaR @PresRajapaksa @SecPompeo 
Please work on to allow @PayPal business accounts (Merchant) in Sri Lanka. There are lot of people in here willing to enter the international market, however it is impossible due to above issue. Among them most are the younger generation. Ecommerce sector is growing in SL gradually and ready to run with the global markets. Lot of traditional product manufacturers are now arising with the current government policies."

If it's the 1% then the Country will receive a total inflow of USD 50 Billion ! Which is it ?

If many CITIZENS wants leave, capitalize e opportunity & send them to all prospective countries removing all HIGH CHARGES by agencies. 

Condition all to send $ remittances immediately Send all lazy government sector employees first! Not according to banks Some government university students leave the country right after graduating and not coming back. Bond should be there to make sure you serve your country at least for 10 years to payback the SL tax money or send certain amount of USD remittance back within a given period.. Agree ලබ්බට තියපු අත පුහුලටත් තියනවා  @an_cabraal What about remittance by Sri Lankan who is doing remote works? Is @CBSL  considering it as ""Service export""? Yes, that was the discussion. NO BANK WAS ASKING TO CONVERT NON RESIDENT WORKER REMITTANCES.  Legalise crypto currency withdrowel to Local bank accounts.. not deposits.. lots of people make/earn  income by trading n holding crypto cruncies  .. let them bring some usd to local banks. Increase the rate by LKR 50 minimum to see the inflow. When the whole world is changing embrace the change, people will not listen to you, you have to Listen to people. Migrant temittance are the key to our economy n they deserve better."
