If many CITIZENS wants leave, capitalize e opportunity & send them to all prospective countries removing all HIGH CHARGES by agencies. 

Condition all to send $ remittances immediately Send all lazy government sector employees first! Not according to banks Some government university students leave the country right after graduating and not coming back. Bond should be there to make sure you serve your country at least for 10 years to payback the SL tax money or send certain amount of USD remittance back within a given period.. Agree ලබ්බට තියපු අත පුහුලටත් තියනවා  @an_cabraal What about remittance by Sri Lankan who is doing remote works? Is @CBSL  considering it as ""Service export""? Yes, that was the discussion. NO BANK WAS ASKING TO CONVERT NON RESIDENT WORKER REMITTANCES.  Legalise crypto currency withdrowel to Local bank accounts.. not deposits.. lots of people make/earn  income by trading n holding crypto cruncies  .. let them bring some usd to local banks. Increase the rate by LKR 50 minimum to see the inflow. When the whole world is changing embrace the change, people will not listen to you, you have to Listen to people.
